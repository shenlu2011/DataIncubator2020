<h2>Latent Semantic Analysis</h2>
<p>
	Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is a technique for text processing. The idea behind latent semantic analysis is that, in psychology, we consider people learn language through words instead of grammar. Think about how babies learn languages. They just put words together and it is going to make sense. However, the context of the words can not be ignored, although we can ignore the grammar. 
	Each word can have multiple meanings in different context and different words can have the same meanings in the same context. This is the most confusing part in text mining, which almost makes it impossible to process the text. However, when LSA comes into play, the myth is deciphered. The way it works is straightforward that it simplifies the content. The formula of LSA is listed below.

	The matrix in the middle is for topics. We start with all the text and it ends up with we project text into several topics and thos topics are related to the text data.
