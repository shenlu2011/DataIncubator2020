<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
	In this project, we need to the popularity of online news from three different sources: Facebook, GooglePlus, and LinkedIn. 
	<li>We define a data model to predict the popularity of a given news.</li>
	<li>We report the performance of the data model in three experiments</li>
	<li>The prediction is close to ground truth and the result is interpretable</li>
	<li>This prediction model can be generally used in different applications. For example, before we advertise products online, we can predict, in comparison with existing advertisements, how popular the new advertisement will be. There are other applications, such as election campaign, news/posts recommendation, dynamic content generation and so on.</li>
